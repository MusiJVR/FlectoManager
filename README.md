## Overview

**FlectoManager** is an application for managing databases using **Spring Framework** and **JavaFX**. It allows easy management of database records, executing SQL queries, as well as creating and editing tables.

---

## Installation

**1**. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/MusiJVR/FlectoManager/releases) section and download the ZIP archive with the desired version of the application.

**2**. Extract the archive to a convenient location.

**3**. Run the `shortcut_creator.bat` file, which will automatically create a desktop shortcut for quick access to the application.

*If you prefer not to use the automatic shortcut creation, you can create it manually by specifying the path to the `.exe` executable file.*

---

### Important Notes
- The ZIP archive already includes **JDK 21.0.5**, so Java installation is not required.
- Upon the first launch and during the application's operation, the following directories will be created:
    - **`config`** — for storing configuration files.
    - **`logs`** — for storing application logs.
    - **`cache`** — for temporary data used by the application.
- **Antivirus warnings**:  
  When launching the executable file (`.exe`) or the `shortcut_creator.bat` script, your antivirus may warn you about a potential threat. This is due to the lack of file certification. You can safely ignore these warnings if you downloaded the files from the official repository.
- Make sure you have write permissions for the folder containing the executable file to avoid errors when creating configuration, logs, and cache.

## Supported Operating Systems

**FlectoManager** is designed to run on **Windows 10/11** (64-bit). It is not recommended to use it on other operating systems due to potential technical issues and lack of testing.

---

## License

**FlectoManager** is distributed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit).
